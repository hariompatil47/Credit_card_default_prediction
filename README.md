### Credit-Card-Default-Prediction
## This is an End to End ML project which is used to predict credit card defaulter.

## Overview
```
This is a classification model for a most common dataset, Credit Card defaulter prediction. Prediction of the next month credit card defaulter based on demographic and last six months behavioral data of customers
```

## Motivation
```
Sometimes even debt that seems manageable, like credit card debt, spirals out of control. Ones that can affect your finances are job loss, health problems, or business failure. under reality, because of the high finance charges (compounded on daily balances) and other penalties, credit card debt is frequently the first to spiral out of control under these circumstances.

Many of us may identify with this situation. We may have missed a couple of credit card payments due to forgetting about the due dates or cash flow problems. But what happens if this carries on for weeks? How can one determine whether a customer will default in the next months?

This concept has been used to lower the risk faced by banks. developed to anticipate consumer defaulters based on behavioural and demographic information such as prior payments and transactions.
